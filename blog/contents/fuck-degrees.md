# Why I Don't Believe in Degrees

(And What I Do Instead)

I'm a dropout, by choice. Not out of laziness. Not because I couldn’t cope. But because I don’t believe in the system — at least not for someone like me, and not in this era.

Let’s get one thing clear: this isn’t about self-pity. I’m not writing from a place of regret or rebellion for its own sake. I’m writing this because I’m sick of pretending that degrees are some sacred rite of passage. They’re not. They’re a **product**, dressed up as prestige. And like most products in a capitalist system, they’re optimized not for individual transformation, but for **profit, predictability, and compliance**.

## The Myth of the Degree

A degree is supposed to represent competence, dedication, and expertise. But in reality, it’s a proxy — a paper token that proves you survived a structure someone else made. There are merits to that, sure. Structure helps some people learn discipline. Certain professions (medicine, engineering, law) _need_ rigorous gatekeeping. But when it comes to software, entrepreneurship, or creative problem-solving? The equation breaks.

We live in a **skills economy**, not a certificate economy. Execution wins. Insight wins. Being useful wins. The world doesn't reward you for having a piece of paper — it rewards you for **being able to do what others can’t**. And if you’re trying to build something new, _you already live outside the syllabus_.

## Smart People Want Money Too

There’s this sneaky narrative I can’t stand — that those who bypass degrees are somehow anti-intellectual or money-obsessed. **Do you think smart people _don’t_ want money?** That we’re not strategic? That we haven’t done the cost-benefit math? A four-year degree can cost \$40,000 to \$200,000, depending on where you are. That’s not just money. That’s time. That’s energy. That’s four years of building your own systems, your own products, your own leverage... gone.

The average return on that paper isn’t what it used to be. Especially if you don’t plan on begging for someone else’s permission to work.

## Capitalism Isn’t Your Friend — It’s the Game

Universities have become **brands**. They sell the illusion of future stability in a volatile, post-pandemic world. But when you strip away the marketing, what are you actually paying for? A rigid syllabus. Outdated teaching methods. Surface-level group projects. And a graduation funnel that prepares you to be **hireable**, not _indispensable_.

In tech, skills are king. Your GitHub is your degree. Your execution is your credential. Your **reputation is public, searchable, and composable** — in tweets, commits, products, and feedback loops. So why let a gatekeeper define your worth?

## What I Do Instead

- I build products. Real ones. Shipped, broken, refined, tested by strangers.
- I learn aggressively. Every day. Through direct source code, papers, essays, forums, mentors, mistakes.
- I reflect openly. I don't pretend to be further along than I am. But I’m always moving.
- I track my growth not by grades, but by how much deeper I can think, and how fast I can execute.

You want to hire someone with a degree? Great. They learned to follow instructions. You want someone who questions defaults, builds leverage from scratch, and thinks in systems? Look for the dropouts who didn’t drop learning — just the paper chase.

My portfolio isn’t a transcript. It’s a living system. It evolves with me. No paper can compete with that.

## 🧭 _If I Can Build It, Why Would I Buy the Permission?_

I keep returning to this one idea — _what makes a person credible_?

People say a university degree gives you credibility. That it opens doors. But when I look at the modern software industry, the biggest doors aren’t opened — they’re **built from scratch**. So I ask myself: if I’m already teaching myself, building things, testing ideas — why should I pay for permission to do what I’m already doing?

The truth is, degrees aren’t really about knowledge anymore. They’re about signaling — a way of telling companies: “I’m safe to hire.” They exist because **corporations needed a filtering mechanism**. Something easy to mass-screen candidates. Over time, that credential became shorthand for trust, reliability, and "proof of intelligence."

But here’s the catch: once you understand that degrees function as **social proof** more than technical preparation, you start realizing you can **reverse-engineer** credibility.

If businesses and senior engineers earn respect by shipping products, solving problems, leading systems — what stops me from doing the same? The degree isn't what made them capable. The work did.

I don’t have a job right now. No salary. No HR manager validating my existence. But I _do_ have a backlog. I have code. I have a brain on fire. And I have no walls around my learning — no syllabus, no grading curve, no ceiling.

This freedom? It’s not passive. It’s aggressive.
It means **I get to move fast**, not because I'm a "startup," but because I’m not waiting for approval.

Of course, it’s not easy. Without a degree, **you lose access to the conveyor belt** — to the recruiters scanning LinkedIn, to the interviews that start with “So where did you study?” You’re no longer granted the benefit of the doubt.

But you don’t need their doubt — because you can give them evidence.

I’m not playing the academic game. I’m playing the **portfolio game**.
A **real project** solves a pain point. It tells a story. It scales.
It **proves competence, not just compliance.**

I see it this way: a degree is a promise.
A product is a **receipt.**

And receipts carry more weight when you’re building your own path.

Many great minds toiled in obscurity. Kafka, Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson. They weren’t failed artists. They just weren’t optimized for the systems of their time. Today, our system is global, open-source, and **attention-driven** — it rewards those who **publish**, not those who wait.

So instead of borrowing \$40K for a credential, I’ve decided to **invest sweat equity into my own education**. I’m building products. Learning systems. Crafting my own path to credibility.

You want to know what makes me credible?

- The fact that I’ve shipped code while others were waiting for approval.
- That I’ve debugged architecture at 3AM without anyone grading me.
- That I can **show you** what I know, not just claim it.

When you build your own education, **your work becomes your credential**.
And when you build from curiosity — not obligation — your hunger goes nuclear.

So no, I’m not just skipping school. I’m building an institution of one.

And I’ll make it credible — by shipping receipts.

If you’ve read this far, thanks. Whether you're another dropout, a founder, or someone in-between, feel free to reach out. I don’t believe in credentials — I believe in proof of work.
