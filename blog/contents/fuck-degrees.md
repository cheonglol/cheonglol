# Why I Don't Believe in Degrees

(And What I Do Instead)

I'm a dropout, by choice. Not out of laziness. Not because I couldn’t cope. But because I don’t believe in the system — at least not for someone like me, and not in this era.

Let’s get one thing clear: this isn’t about self-pity. I’m not writing from a place of regret or rebellion for its own sake. I’m writing this because I’m sick of pretending that degrees are some sacred rite of passage. They’re not. They’re a **product**, dressed up as prestige. And like most products in a capitalist system, they’re optimized not for individual transformation, but for **profit, predictability, and compliance**.

## The Myth of the Degree

A degree is supposed to represent competence, dedication, and expertise. But in reality, it’s a proxy — a paper token that proves you survived a structure someone else made. There are merits to that, sure. Structure helps some people learn discipline. Certain professions (medicine, engineering, law) _need_ rigorous gatekeeping. But when it comes to software, entrepreneurship, or creative problem-solving? The equation breaks.

We live in a **skills economy**, not a certificate economy. Execution wins. Insight wins. Being useful wins. The world doesn't reward you for having a piece of paper — it rewards you for **being able to do what others can’t**. And if you’re trying to build something new, _you already live outside the syllabus_.

## Smart People Want Money Too

There’s this sneaky narrative I can’t stand — that those who bypass degrees are somehow anti-intellectual or money-obsessed. **Do you think smart people _don’t_ want money?** That we’re not strategic? That we haven’t done the cost-benefit math? A four-year degree can cost \$40,000 to \$200,000, depending on where you are. That’s not just money. That’s time. That’s energy. That’s four years of building your own systems, your own products, your own leverage... gone.

The average return on that paper isn’t what it used to be. Especially if you don’t plan on begging for someone else’s permission to work.

## Capitalism Isn’t Your Friend — It’s the Game

Universities have become **brands**. They sell the illusion of future stability in a volatile, post-pandemic world. But when you strip away the marketing, what are you actually paying for? A rigid syllabus. Outdated teaching methods. Surface-level group projects. And a graduation funnel that prepares you to be **hireable**, not _indispensable_.

In tech, skills are king. Your GitHub is your degree. Your execution is your credential. Your **reputation is public, searchable, and composable** — in tweets, commits, products, and feedback loops. So why let a gatekeeper define your worth?

## What I Do Instead

- I build products. Real ones. Shipped, broken, refined, tested by strangers.
- I learn aggressively. Every day. Through direct source code, papers, essays, forums, mentors, mistakes.
- I reflect openly. I don't pretend to be further along than I am. But I’m always moving.
- I track my growth not by grades, but by how much deeper I can think, and how fast I can execute.

The difference between a degree-holder and me? **I learn because I must. I build because I can’t sit still. I’m not motivated by passing — I’m motivated by necessity.**

## Final Thought

You want to hire someone with a degree? Great. They learned to follow instructions. You want someone who questions defaults, builds leverage from scratch, and thinks in systems? Look for the dropouts who didn’t drop learning — just the paper chase.

My portfolio isn’t a transcript. It’s a living system. It evolves with me. No paper can compete with that.

If you’ve read this far, thanks. Whether you're another dropout, a founder, or someone in-between, feel free to reach out. I don’t believe in credentials — I believe in proof of work.
