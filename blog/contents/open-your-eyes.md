You ever notice how some people—not super smart, not super articulate, not even necessarily hard-working in the way people glorify—just somehow made a business work?

I’m not talking about rich kids inheriting something. I mean people who, in the last 5 years, figured it out. People who didn’t go the “correct” route but ended up with something of their own anyway. And yeah, when I look at that, it kind of... breaks the idea I had growing up, that you had to be the smartest or the most qualified or the best to make it. That success was a ladder and everyone was climbing it the same way.

It’s not true, though. Not everyone with a degree gets a stable job. Not everyone who followed the formula ends up secure. And not everyone without credentials ends up stuck.

I don’t think the world is structured for everyone to be at the top. There isn’t room. And I don’t mean that in a cynical way—I mean it practically. So then, what do you do? If you're not aiming to be number one, or the most credentialed, or the most approved?

You look for the path that makes more sense. Maybe one that's less impressive on the surface, but more efficient. More meaningful. More sustainable for you. Not the one people keep pointing at, but the one that actually fits your rhythm, your energy, your mind.

I don’t think you need to know everything. You don’t need to be a genius. You just need to know enough. Just enough to build. Just enough to ship. Just enough to run something without someone else holding the keys.

And yeah... that’s the path I’m going to take. Not to be the best—just to build something I can own. Something I can shape. That’s enough for me. That’s the version of success I believe in.

Not excellence. Just ownership. Not perfection. Just progress.

Because honestly? That’s what works.
