The original `cheonglol/cheonglol` repository was removed. This workspace will be used as an experiment in developer experience and building with AI.

Planned experiments:

- Streamlining local DX with Bun + Astro.
- Using oRPC (unnoq) for end-to-end typed RPC between frontend and backend.
- Automating future blog posting via a Telegram workflow.

This post is intentionally short — it documents intent and the direction for future posts.
