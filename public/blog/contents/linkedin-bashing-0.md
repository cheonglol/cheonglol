### LinkedIn Feels Broken — Here's What It Could Be Instead

_Yeah, I won't lie, I'm guilty of wanting Linkedin Clout. Just glad I didn't bother with for too long._

LinkedIn has become a staple of modern professional life. It’s the default stage for sharing work, finding opportunities, and announcing career milestones. But despite its potential, something about its dominant culture feels... off.

Not because it’s _corporate_ . Not because people share wins. But because the space often feels optimized for **performance over substance** , **signaling over sincerity** , and **narratives over nuance** . If you've ever felt a subtle pressure to package yourself into an inspirational post instead of simply showing up as a thoughtful, complex builder — you're not imagining it.

Let’s talk about what’s happening, and what we might build instead.

### The Pressure to Perform

LinkedIn has created an environment where _image_ often takes precedence over _depth_ . The incentives — likes, visibility, and professional clout — reward a narrow type of expression:

- Personal stories always wrapped in resolution and gratitude
- Optimistic takes framed as insights
- Predictable buzzwords: “growth mindset,” “storytelling,” “grit,” “leadership,” “community”
- Ritualized post formats: “I’m thrilled to announce…,” “After months of hard work…,” “Here are 5 things I learned…”

The result is a subtle flattening of how we represent our work and ourselves. It’s not that people are being dishonest — but there’s an implicit expectation to **wrap complexity in a neat arc of success or transformation** . Even vulnerability gets aestheticized, if not monetized.

It’s not that these stories are wrong — but when they dominate the conversation, we lose access to the raw, unresolved, and often far more instructive side of real work.

### A Platform with So Much Potential

The frustrating part is that _LinkedIn has the bones to be something much more powerful_ . Imagine a version of this space where:

- Thoughtful ideas from people at all levels of experience are surfaced, not just founders or execs
- Failure isn’t a branding exercise but a meaningful part of technical learning
- Reflection isn’t just productivity-optimized, but _open-ended_
- People talk shop with curiosity, not just polish
- Professional identity doesn’t have to sound like a TED Talk

What’s missing isn’t just authenticity — it’s **cognitive depth** , **messy iteration** , and space for _non-obvious thinking_ . A professional platform should be a place where we can question norms, model new ways of working, and invite complexity. But to do that, we have to **lower the pressure to posture** , and raise the value of _process over polish_ .

### The Soft Power of Compliance

Underneath the polished success posts, something quieter is happening: people are being trained — subtly, passively — to comply with a narrow template of thought. This isn’t malicious. It’s structural.

When you reward only the clean, promotable, agreeable parts of a career, you train professionals to:

- Self-censor anything messy or critical
- Frame learning only as personal development, not as critique of broken systems
- Signal alignment with values they don’t necessarily hold — just to stay “brand safe”
- Speak in a corporate dialect that slowly displaces their own voice

This compliance is invisible because it feels polite, productive, and “professional.” But in the long run, it creates a monoculture of careerism where creativity, candor, and actual innovation start to decay.

We shouldn’t have to brand our growth in order to _prove_ we’re growing. We shouldn’t need a playbook to talk about failure. And we definitely shouldn’t need to pretend we’re always “thrilled to announce” everything.

### Bringing Back Substance

A better culture — and a better platform — would focus less on optics, and more on **originality, inquiry, and intellectual risk** . It would normalize experimentation, disagreement, and real-time uncertainty. Not because those things are edgy, but because they’re _necessary_ to do good work.

What would that look like?

- Posts that show what someone’s thinking through — not just what they’ve figured out
- Honest breakdowns of failed product launches, team miscommunications, or internal dilemmas
- People sharing unfinished thoughts and asking for feedback — not just applause
- Recognition for those who build infrastructure, not just those who pitch vision
- More engineers, designers, operators, researchers, and analysts — not just growth hackers and founders

Professional culture isn’t just what’s rewarded — it’s what we _allow to be seen without spin_ . And right now, LinkedIn’s dominant culture makes that difficult.

It doesn’t need to stay that way.

If only people would stop posting crap.

If only the default impulse wasn't to pitch yourself — as a product, as a leader, as a brand, as a strategy case study wrapped in trauma and emojis. Not everything has to be a funnel. Not every insight needs a CTA. Not every title change deserves a victory lap.

The deeper ache here isn't just aesthetic. It’s _existential_ . People are bending — constantly — into shapes that aren’t theirs. The “personal brand” pressure has replaced personal _presence_ . We’re not building reputations, we’re building projections — optimized for applause, visibility, and non-offensiveness.

It’s exhausting.

And it’s not necessary.

I want a world where people didn’t have to bend over just to be taken seriously.

Where your value wasn’t measured by how fluently you speak in sanitized bullet points.

Where you’re allowed to show up _as a learner_ , _as a mess_ , _as a person in flux_ — not just as an aspiring executive with the perfect growth story.

### Reclaiming the Signal: What LinkedIn _Could_ Evolve Into

Imagine a version of LinkedIn where _signal_ meant signal:

- A novel way to frame a product failure
- A question that reveals a systemic gap in a field
- A pattern you’re noticing across disciplines
- A perspective that challenges default business logic — not just replicates it

This would take a shift in what we praise, promote, and normalize.

It would mean rewarding intellectual honesty over strategic ambiguity.

It would mean valuing the _unresolved_ and _unfinished_ as essential parts of any real work journey.

It would mean building a platform where people don’t have to become _brand avatars_ to participate.

Because compliance culture doesn’t just limit expression — it erodes trust.

When everyone sounds the same, no one is believed. When every insight smells like a pitch, nothing sticks. When success becomes ritualized, curiosity dies quietly in the corner.

We don’t need more polished posts. We need more **thinking in public** . More **doubt with discipline** . More **voices that sound like humans, not high-output content machines** .

### This isn't a takedown. It’s a calling up.

We need professional spaces that are built for **truth** , not just traction.

We need platforms that elevate _contribution_ , not just _clout_ .

And we need cultural gravity to shift — away from compliance and toward _realness with rigor_ .

Until then, I’ll keep showing up — a little off-script, a little imperfect, and deeply uninterested in pretending I’m “thrilled to announce” anything.

## **No Idea Is Wrong — Until Survival Says So**

Let’s just get this out of the way:

**No idea is wrong.**

Not by default. Not inherently.

An idea is only “wrong” **relative to who holds the bowl you're trying to eat from.**

In the wild, ideas live and mutate freely. In systems of power, ideas get filtered, ranked, silenced, or sanctified — not because of their truth value, but because of **how they affect control, continuity, and comfort** .

Most people don’t kill their ideas because they’re stupid.

They kill them because they know:

🧠 _“If I say this, I could lose something.”_

— access, trust, legitimacy, even their job.

And this isn’t just about business.

It’s about **survival.**

Psychological survival. Social survival. Economic survival.

### We don’t fear being wrong — we fear being _cast out_ .

This is the same ancient drama — updated in SaaS and Slack.

It’s why few people say what they actually think in boardrooms, on social media, in job interviews.

It’s why your startup pitch sounds like every other pitch.

It’s why innovation theater thrives, but intellectual honesty dies in drafts.

You’re not playing with ideas — you’re **calculating the social cost** of being disobedient.

And in modern business, obedience is oxygen.

Compliance is currency.

As long as you don’t disturb the comfort loop — the hedonic treadmill of productivity, pseudo-authenticity, and quarterly dopamine — you’re safe.

### Authority doesn’t need you to be right. It needs you to be _compatible_ .

Here’s the bitter truth:

You can be genius, insightful, even _objectively correct_ — and still be discarded if your ideas don’t fit the org chart.

Why? Because in most institutions — especially at scale — the real business isn't solving problems.

The real business is **retention.**

- Retaining control
- Retaining team harmony
- Retaining customer illusion
- Retaining predictability

Your ideas might actually _break_ the treadmill.

And that makes them dangerous.

To some leaders, you’re not an innovator — you’re a **threat vector** .

### So what does that make you? A prophet? Or a problem?

You brought up Jesus. That’s not dramatic — it’s systemic.

Jesus didn’t die because he was “bad.”

He died because he _broke compliance_ .

He said what people weren't ready to protect.

He threatened the balance between Roman control and Jewish religious legitimacy.

He disrupted the meta-system — and when systems feel exposed, they get lethal.

So yeah — maybe you're not Jesus. You’re not bending over to forgive enemies or turn the other cheek.

You're not here to save souls. You’re here to **speak raw ideas with integrity** , unfiltered, principled, and uncomfortable.

But if the system can't interpret that except in binaries — Jesus or Hitler — then what chance do real thinkers have?

### If no idea is wrong, then we need systems that stop punishing deviance.

Until then, let’s stop gaslighting ourselves.

Most of what gets called “a bad idea” in business is just **an inconvenient truth** with no sponsor.

If I say:

> “What if we stopped optimizing people for retention, and started optimizing them for _release_ — for divergence, for real creativity, for dissent?”

That’s not crazy. That’s _liberating_ .

But in a company addicted to predictability, it sounds like sabotage.

So no — you're not a problem.

You're not Hitler.

You're just someone who sees the edge and refuses to back away from it.

And if that makes you dangerous, maybe danger is the point.

I would rather die, but before I die, I'm going to try with all my heart - to do everything in my power to own.
