**Why I Hated Tech People in School — and Why It’s Worse in Singapore**

In tech circles, especially in school, there’s a particular stench in the air that nobody wants to name. A mix of ego, insecurity, transactionalism, and deep emotional avoidance. You walk into a computer science classroom expecting shared curiosity, excitement over learning, maybe even some solidarity in struggling with complexity. What you get instead is a quiet war of posture. A room full of people who can’t be happy for each other, who treat every win like a personal loss, and who have learned to measure their worth by how impressive they _seem_ , not how deeply they _understand_ . And in Singapore? That dysfunction is systematized.

Singapore didn’t invent toxic tech culture. But it supercharges it.

This is a country built on meritocracy—on paper. In practice, it’s a performance culture obsessed with ranking, compliance, and survival. From age six, we’re taught that success is a scoreboard and everyone else is a threat. That mentality doesn’t leave when you enter tech. It just mutates. You don’t collaborate with your peers—you compete with them, silently, politely, sometimes even while pretending to be friendly. Every time someone lands a better internship, gets praise from a professor, or builds something meaningful, it triggers this twisted instinct: _Why not me? Did I fall behind? What did I do wrong?_

It becomes impossible to be genuinely happy for others. And equally impossible to be seen without being envied.

I’ve seen people get jealous when classmates presented something original, or when someone casually mentioned a side project that was taking off. Not openly. Never openly. But you feel it in their silence, their subtle shifts, their backhanded compliments. In Singaporean tech culture, emotional honesty is dangerous. Vulnerability is weakness. And so people keep everything behind a polished exterior—LinkedIn-ready, GitHub-active, LeetCode-optimized. The human being underneath? Starving for connection, but trained not to show it.

Many aren’t even in this field because they love it. They’re here because it’s stable. Lucrative. Safe. They see software not as craft, but as capital. They optimize for salary, for status, for early equity. And then they judge those who _do_ love the work—accusing them of being naive, idealistic, or wasting time on “passion projects.” It’s the blind leading the burned out.

And for the ones who _are_ technically brilliant—those rare few who are truly good—they often come with egos the size of Marina Bay Sands. Once someone realizes they're above average, they act like gods. They gatekeep conversations, condescend to those who don’t speak their stack, and treat product design, ethics, or human impact as distractions for lesser minds. It’s an arrogance born not from depth, but from a society that fast-tracks excellence and forgets to ask if there’s wisdom to match the skill.

All of this reflects the larger Singapore condition: economic survival dressed as ambition. We’ve built a hyper-efficient machine of a country, but in doing so, we’ve deformed the inner lives of its people. We tell children to pursue excellence but punish any detour that doesn’t fit the script. We say “be creative,” but give no room to fail without shame. We reward quiet compliance, not intellectual bravery.

That’s why Singapore’s tech students rarely experiment, rarely speak up, rarely push boundaries. They’re afraid. Afraid to look stupid. Afraid to be seen trying something weird and failing. The system doesn’t reward process. It rewards polish.

Even school projects become a performance. People choose topics that sound smart, not ones they care about. They code just enough to get the grade or the GitHub stars. No joy. No play. No soul. Just resumes in progress.

But don’t mistake this for an attack on ambition. I’m not romanticizing failure or attacking competence. I’m angry because I know it could be _different_ . Tech—when it’s honest—is a place where misfits can find their edge, where builders can create meaning, where people can rise without pushing others down. But in Singapore, we turned it into just another academic arms race. Another market. Another way to rank ourselves into oblivion.

I didn’t leave tech. I left _that version_ of tech. The lifeless, clout-chasing, emotionally constipated culture that breeds in schools, and especially thrives under the Singaporean model. I’m building something slower, deeper, more human. A culture where curiosity matters more than credentials. Where we can share wins without envy. Where being _useful_ matters more than being _impressive_ .

> In a society that values appearance over essence, the soul becomes the first casualty.
