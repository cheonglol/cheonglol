I don’t plan to live long—not as a stunt, but as the sum of a life that taught me to count scars. When I was nine, my parents split. I stayed with Dad, learning grief in a house that felt both hollow and fragile. At thirteen I moved back in with Mum, and stability evaporated: daily arguments, her endless parade of boyfriends, my growing sense that home was just another battlefield. Then Dad died of a heart attack—sudden, irrevocable—leaving me untethered and navigating forms I barely understood.

At twenty, I landed an internship. By twenty-one, it turned into a full-time role. Three years of paying my own rent, signing my own paychecks, convincing myself that “making it” looked like this. But every paycheck felt like rent on someone else’s script. University beckoned as escape, but it funneled me toward the same corridors of expectation. I dropped out again—still lost, but this time with a small nest egg and a fierce refusal to settle.

Mum survived thyroid cancer. During her treatment, my aunt—her own sister—coaxed Mum into naming her executor of Mum’s will. Only later did Mum learn the truth: the inheritance belonged to her sons. I fought to reclaim what was always ours. That betrayal by blood taught me that family loyalty is conditional, and trust must be earned.

Now I have just enough savings to last a few years if I stay frugal. Every dollar I don’t spend is runway. Every hour I don’t squander is a chance to build something under my name—a tool, a piece of software, an idea—so that if I vanish, there’s a trace of meaning, not just an absence. I don’t expect gratitude. I’m not chasing applause. I’m chasing a signal in the silence.

I’ve known exhaustion that feels bone-deep, nights on rooftops weighing the cost of another breath. I’ve tried to end my life before—because losing Dad, living through Mum’s illness and betrayal, and fighting legal battles taught me to question survival’s promise. Yet I stayed—because maybe there’s one thing I can create, one person I can help, one fragment of purpose I can piece together.

Here’s the contract: live kindly without expecting return; spend sparingly as discipline, not deprivation; build relentlessly until the silence answers or remains indifferent. When I’ve given every scrap I have and the world barely blinks, I’ll exit quietly—complete, not defeated.

If you find this, don’t mythologize me. Just check:
Did I leave something behind?
