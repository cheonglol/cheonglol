I don’t plan to live long—not as drama, but as the calculus of my scars. At nine, my parents split. I stayed with Dad, learning grief in rooms that felt simultaneously hollow and on the verge of collapse. A few years later I moved in with Mum, only to trade one instability for another: daily arguments, her parade of boyfriends, the sense that “home” was a revolving door of half-truths. Then Dad died of a heart attack—sudden, irrevocable—leaving me bereft and navigating paperwork I barely understood.

By twenty I’d landed an internship, and within a year it became a full-time job. Three years of rent, bills, routines—proof I could survive on my own but not proof I wanted to. University beckoned as escape, but it led me back toward the same script I’d already outgrown. I dropped out again—still lost, but now with a small nest egg and a refusal to settle for a life that erased me.

I carried a darkness through it all. There were nights I stood at the edge, exhausted beyond tears, because losing Dad hurt, losing Mum to thyroid cancer hurt more. In her weakest moment, my aunt—her own sister—coaxed Mum into naming her executor of Mum’s will. Only later did Mum learn the truth—the inheritance belonged to her sons. I fought to reclaim what was always ours. That betrayal by blood taught me loyalty is conditional and trust must be earned.

Now I have just enough savings to last a few years if I stay frugal. Every dollar I don’t spend is runway. Every hour I don’t squander is code, design, or strategy toward something real under my name. I want to build things. I want to open a software studio—a place where my scars become the fuel for products that solve real problems, that carry the honesty of my history. If all else fails, if I pour everything into that studio and the world still blinks in silence, then I’ll leave this world. Not in defeat, but in completion.

This isn’t a plea. It’s a contract with myself: live kindly without expectation; spend sparingly as discipline, not deprivation; build relentlessly until the silence either answers or remains indifferent. And when I’ve given everything I have and the ledger balances, I’ll exit quietly—complete, not defeated.

If you find this, don’t mythologize me. Just check:
Did I leave something behind?
