# cheonglol — personal portfolio & blog (scaffold)

This repository is a minimal portfolio + blog scaffold. It was generated by an assistant and reviewed by the repository owner. Content is intentionally neutral and factual.

Stack (owner preference)

- Frontend: Astro (TypeScript + React) — built with Bun
- Backend: Fastify (TypeScript) + Prisma (schema included)
- Deploy: GitHub Pages (CI workflow included)

What you get in this commit

- Multi-page Astro site (landing + blog) with an initial post.
- Backend skeleton (Fastify) with Prisma schema for blog posts (SQLite by default).
- CI workflow that builds the frontend with Bun and deploys to GitHub Pages.
- A local-only script to generate resume metadata using the `gh` CLI (does not publish private data).

Quick start (Windows, cmd.exe)

1. Install (requires Bun):
   bun install
2. Frontend dev:
   cd frontend && bun dev
3. Backend dev:
   cd backend && bun run dev

How resume data is handled

- A script `scripts/gh-resume.ts` can pull your public repo metadata using the `gh` CLI locally. The scaffold will NOT publish private repos by default; run the script locally and inspect the output before including it on the site.

Content note

- The initial blog post explains why the original `cheonglol/cheonglol` repo was removed and the intent for this workspace (developer-experience experiments + AI-assisted workflows).

License

- MIT (changeable — tell me which license you prefer and I will update the repo).

If you'd like, I can now:

- open a PR with this scaffold and CI
- switch Pages to serve from `docs/` on `main` instead of `gh-pages`
- wire the backend to a Postgres instance and enable Prisma migrations

Tell me which of the above you'd like next (or any edits to content/tone).
